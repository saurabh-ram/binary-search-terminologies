# Simplifying Binary Search Terminologies: Introducing Superior Bound and Inferior Bound

## Introduction

Binary search is a classic algorithm used to efficiently find a target value in a sorted array. However, the terminology used to describe its bounds often results in confusion — especially for beginners and even experienced developers.

- **"Lower Bound"** often refers to the smallest *`index`*, the value of which is **greater than or equal to** the target, i.e., `≥ target`. But when we think of "lower," we naturally expect it to mean **less than** the target (`< target`).
- **"Upper Bound"** refers to the smallest *`index`*, the value of which is **greater than** the target, i.e., `> target`. But "upper" could imply **greater than or equal to**, which leaves room for confusion.

Additionally, there's no standard term for the first element **strictly less than** the target (`< target`), creating a gap in the terminology. This lack of clarity can lead to misunderstanding, especially for new learners or when teaching binary search to someone unfamiliar with the concept.

<br/>

## The Proposal: Superior Bound and Inferior Bound

To solve this confusion, we propose **two new terms** that align directly with the strict inequalities used in binary search:


| Term                | Operator | Meaning                                                                              |
|---------------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Superior Bound**  |    `>`   | Smallest *`index`* with the value **strictly greater than** the target (`> target`)  |
| **Inferior Bound**  |    `<`   | Largest *`index`* with the value **strictly less than** the target (`< target`)      |

<br/>

## Why do these terms work?
- **Linguistic clarity**: "Superior" means greater, and "Inferior" means lesser. They sound **natural**.
- **Mathematically precise**: These terms match the strict inequalities used in binary search.
- **Intuitive**: The meanings of the terms align with what most people expect based on common language.

By introducing these terms, we can eliminate ambiguity and make binary search easier to explain and understand.

## Example


```markdown

Array: [ 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7 ]
                  ↑           ↑
        Inferior Bound      Superior Bound
        (Largest < 4)       (Smallest > 4)

Target: 4

```

<br/>

## Code Examples

Here’s how we can implement binary search using these new terms.

## Inferior Bound (largest index of the element `< target`)

The **Inferior Bound** finds the largest index where the element is **strictly less than** the target. This scenario is commonly used when you need the **last element** that is less than the target.

```java
// Finding Inferior Bound: Largest index of the element with value < target
public int findInferiorBound(int[] nums, int target) {
    int s = 0;
    int e = nums.length - 1;
    while (s <= e) {
        int mid = s + ((e - s) >> 1);
        if (nums[mid] < target) {
            s = mid + 1;
        } else {
            e = mid - 1;
        }
    }
    // Last index where nums[e] < target
    return e;
}
```

## Superior Bound (smallest index of the element `> target`)

The **Superior Bound** finds the **first element** that is **strictly greater than** the target. This scenario is often used when you want to find where the target **could be inserted** if it were greater than all the existing elements.

```java
// Finding Superior Bound: Smallest index of the element with value > target
public int findSuperiorBound(int[] nums, int target) {
    int s = 0;
    int e = nums.length - 1;
    while (s <= e) {
        int mid = s + ((e - s) >> 1);
        if (nums[mid] <= target) {
            s = mid + 1;
        } else {
            e = mid - 1;
        }
    }
    // First index where nums[s] > target
    return s;
}
```

<br/>

## Why does this change matter?

1. **Better Communication**:

   * Using **"Superior Bound"** and **"Inferior Bound"** means you don’t have to second-guess what each term means. It’s immediately clear that **superior** is greater and **inferior** is less.

2. **Fewer Bugs**:

   * By being more precise with the terminology, you reduce the chance of introducing miscommunication or making incorrect assumptions about the bounds.

3. **Clearer for Beginners**:

   * Newcomers to binary search will have a **clearer mental model** when learning how the algorithm works, and can focus more on understanding use cases than remembering the definition, making it easier for instructors to teach the concept.

4. **Better Interviews**:

   * When you use clearer terminology in interviews, interviewers will appreciate the precision and clarity in your explanation, which can help make you stand out amongst others.

## How to Contribute

If you think these new terms could help improve understanding of binary search, here are a few ways you can contribute:

1. **Use these terms in your own code**: If you're an educator, developer, or student, start using **Inferior Bound** and **Superior Bound** in your teaching materials and coding projects as comments.
2. **Share the article**: Help spread the word by sharing this article with your friends, colleagues, or on social media.
3. **Contribute to open-source projects**: Propose adopting these terms in popular open-source repos or educational projects that deal with binary search. 

<br/>

> **Note**: The terms *Superior Bound* (`>`) and *Inferior Bound* (`<`) introduced here are **not part of any formal CS standard or API** yet. They're offered as clear, intuitive terminology that fills a gap in common binary search language.

## Conclusion

Binary search is one of the most fundamental algorithms in computer science, but its terminology can cause confusion sometimes. By adopting **Superior Bound** and **Inferior Bound**, we can eliminate the ambiguity and make binary search more intuitive for everyone — from learners to developers to interviewees.

By using **clearer terminology**, we can avoid misunderstandings, reduce errors, and make learning binary search easier.
